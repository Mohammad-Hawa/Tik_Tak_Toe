# Tik_Tak_Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O) game is a simple game developed using Flutter for two players to compete on the same device. The game allows players to choose "X" or "O" and place them in cells on a 3x3 grid. A winner is determined when one player aligns three marks in a row. The game can be restarted after a match to play again.
